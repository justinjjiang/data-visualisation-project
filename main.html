            words with powerful rhetoric to sway crowds and impose their ideas. Whilst the old English rhyme says <i>“sticks and stones 
            may break your bones, but words may never hurt you”</i>, words do indeed have the power to hurt.<br><br>
            Words have been used throughout history to fight for change, such as Martin Luther King Jr’s “I have a dream” speech and 
            Paul Keating’s “Redfern Speech”, but do your words hold the same power today? As we tackle a vast number of issues, 
            such as climate change, does your voice have the power to bring about change? Do your words make a difference? <br><br>

            in the house of representatives saying,</p>

        <p class="article">So, climate change has been an issue for a while now, but how has Australia responded? What has been the progress 
            in tackling this undoubted issue?<br><br>Under the Morrison government, efforts in increasing climate action has been extremely 
            underwhelming. Whilst the government adopted a net-zero target by 2025 (meaning that an emissions are balanced by absorbing an 
            equivalent amount from the atmosphere), Australia is falling short on this target by a considerable margin.<br><br></p>

         <p class="article"><br><br>Australia’s improvement in our carbon emissions has been evidently insufficient, as from 2015 to 2020, the country 
             has only had a 1.493 tonnes per person improvement as well as only a one rank improvement in our emissions from 10th to 11th. As of 
             2020, Australia is projected to reach roughly 22% below 2005 levels by 2030, which falls short of its Paris Agreement target of 26-28%. 
             Whilst it is clear that the government needs to increase their ambition in committing to, and also increasing their 2030 target, they are 
             doing the opposite. The 2020-21 budget allocates a large sum of money to non-renewable energy infrastructures. <br><br><b><i>If other countries 
                 were to follow suit, warming could reach over 3 degrees and up to 4 degrees higher.</i></b><br><br><br>

            So, yes climate change is an issue. The Australian government has been promising climate action, but has been considerably under-delivering. 
            What’s our response? What can we do about it? How can we make a climate change?</p>
        
        <h2 class = "article"><b>-<br>Reason to Protest</h2>
        <p class="article">Whilst Mr Morrison suggests that protests only act as “an unlimited license to disrupt people’s lives”, protests have the power 
            to keep politicians accountable. Your voice has the power to change. As people grow tired and unsatisfied with the lack of change, climate strikes 
            and protests have been used as an instrument in making collective voices heard.</p>
        <p class='quote'><br><i><b>Do you think striking is an effective mechanism in fighting for change, or is it just an inconvenience?</b></i></p>
        <p class="article"><br>Climate protests are a manifestation of dissent and dissatisfaction for the urgent need to change policy. Non-violent protests and 
            strikes have been a force behind positive social change by promoting awareness at both a micro level and gaining greater media attention at a macro 
            level. In shifting public opinion, strikes increases the pressure on people in power and paves a way for new strategies in combatting global warming.<br><br>
            In September 2019, the Fridays for the Future (FFF) protest campaign organised the third Global Climate Strike, with 7.6 million people participating 
            in 6000 protests across 185 countries. This gives us an opportunity to explore what the contributions climate strikes have on the strive for change.
        <br><br><br><b>The effectiveness and contributions climate strikes have had can be explored in three areas:</b></p>
        <p class="emph"><br><i>1. Media attention allows for shift in public perception<br><br>2. Social and psychological impacts on those who participate, and<br><br>
            3. The pressure put on those in political power.</i></p>

        <h2 class = "article"><b>1. Media Attention</h2>
        <p class="article">A significant impact climate protests and strikes have on change is its ability to grab the attention of the media. The amount of people 
            participating in these movements consequently lead to a bigger interest of the media in the cause. This is evident through the increased amount of tweets 
            surrounding the topic of climate change and action throughout the years. The effect strikes have on media attention is exemplified through the evident 
            spike in 2019, following the great amount of protests organised by FFF.<br></p>
        <div class="graph2">
            <div id="twitterPlot"></div>
        </div>
        <p class="article">The increased coverage of the issue on major news outlets and social media platforms further leads to an increased awareness of climate change, 
            as well as shifts in public perception.</p>
        <div class="graph2">
            <div id="droughtConcern"></div>
        </div>
        <p class="article">As New South Wales was declared in drought during the latter half of 2018, the state had the highest levels of concern for climate-induced 
            droughts. This season of droughts combined with the ongoing coverage of climate action through media outlets had an undoubted impact on the public perception 
            surrounding this issue.</p>

        <h2 class = "article"><b>2. Social and <br>Psychological Impacts</h2>
        <p class="article">With the lack of progress made in combatting this issue, people may start to feel a sense of hopelessness and despair. However, the collective 
            act of strikes and protests has the power to overpower the lack of action with a sense of community and solidarity. Strikes become places where ideas emerge, 
            disinformation is eliminated, and new strategies can 
            be developed. </p>
        <div class="graph3">
            <div id="feelings"></div>
            <div id="statement"></div>
        </div>

        <h2 class = "article"><b>3. Political Change</h2>
        <p class="article">Striking can also have a positive impact on policy-making as politicians tend to listen to what is being demanded. This is especially true for 
            political candidates seeking to get voted in for election. The most recent example is shown in Australia’s 2022 election with the labour party led by Anthony 
            Albanese being voted in over the other parties. One significant factor leading to his success was his promises surrounding Australia’s climate.<br><br><br></p>
        <p class="emph">
            This is shown with him promising that he will deliver a <b><i>“big shift in climate policy”</i></b> to make the country 
                a <b><i>“renewable energy superpower”.</i></b></p>
            <p class="quote"><b>”We have an opportunity now to end the climate wars in Australia...”<br><br>
                Albanese has also “promised to adopt more ambitious emissions targets”.</b></p>

        <h2 class = "article"><b>-<br>So, What Now?</h2>
        <p class="article">With the rise of the climate movement, people’s climate awareness has undoubtedly risen. Whilst there is still a lot of work to be done before 
            the greatest victory for the climate movement to come, we can look at the progress made already throughout the years in transforming the world toward a more 
            sustainable one.<br><br>
            With a new political party being voted in this year, continued pressure for climate action should be done. Let’s see whether we make progress in negating this 
            issue, or whether it will be another case of <i>“overpromise and underdeliver”.</i><br><br></p>
